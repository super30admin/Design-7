## Problem1 LFU Cache

Design and implement a data structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.

put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.

Example:

LFUCache cache = new LFUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );


cache.put(1, 1);

cache.put(2, 2);

cache.get(1);       // returns 1

cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2

cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)

cache.get(3);       // returns 3.

cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1.

cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)

cache.get(3);       // returns 3

cache.get(4);       // returns 4

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

Output: 3 

Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

## Problem2 Snake game (https://leetcode.com/problems/design-snake-game/)

Design a Snake game that is played on a device with screen size = width x height. Play the game online if you are not familiar with the game.

The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner (0,0) with length = 1 unit.

You are given a list of food's positions in row-column order. When a snake eats the food, its length and the game's score both increase by 1.

Each food appears one by one on the screen. For example, the second food will not appear until the first food was eaten by the snake.

When a food does appear on the screen, it is guaranteed that it will not appear on a block occupied by the snake
