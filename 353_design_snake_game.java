                    A) Initialize the variables width, height, food and snake.
                    B) Also, intialize head with (0,0) value and add it to snake list. Snake is tarting from this point.
                    C) Now in move function, move the head according to the input string 
                    D) Then, check if move is out of bound. If it is then return -1;
                    E) After that check if it is colliding with itself. traverse through snake linkedlist and check the
                       head pointer matches it if it matches then it is colliding and return -1.
                    F) If food is eaten, then add it to the snake list and remove from food list. Return size()-1.
                    G) At the regular move, remove from snake start and add tp end with head pointers.
                    H) At the ed, return size()-1.
